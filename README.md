# Intelligent-Minutes-of-Meeting-MoM
With everyone across the organization working remotely due to the COVID-19 outbreak, virtual platforms are the new medium to connect and interact. Intelligent Minutes of Meeting (MoM) system is an AI-enabled transcription and keyword extraction pipeline. It tags multiple speakers, generates the MoM summary and extracts important keywords using Speech-to-Text and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from a pre-recorded meeting video. The goal of this pipeline is to reduce the effort of manual MoM preparation to the maximum extent possible.
